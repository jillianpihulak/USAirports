# US Airports
This map shows the airports around the United States as of 2016 according to the USGS, 
including Puerto Rico. Each green plane icon represents an airport with a conrol tower,
and each black plane icon represents an airport without a control tower. Each state/territory
is clickable and will open a pop up that displays the name of the state and how many airports are
in that area. Clicking on a plane icon will display the name of the airport and the city and 
state/territory that the airport is in. A color ramp in the legend visually and efficiently displays
the number of airports in the given area. In the opposite corner, a scale in both imperial
and metric units is shown, and adapts to the zoom level.
